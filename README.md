# Bachelor-Thesis-FairProfit: Blockchain-based payment to enable fair profit distribution

This is the official repository related to my bachelor thesis: **Blockchain-based payment to enable fair profit distribution** (01.2022)

This directory contains three different files:
- FairContract: Smart Contract of the aproach
- FairWebApp: WebApp of the approach
- Thesis: File of the bachelor thesis

So far, existing proof-of-concepts for real-world blockchain applications in the area of
supply chains focus on the traceability of products and neglect the transparency of the
payments. Therefore, the thesis aims to build a fair profit distribution application based
on blockchain technology, which provides its users full transparency and verifiability about
all payments being made in its domain and erases the need for the constant control of
certification organizations in the area of fair trade products.

Therefore, the approach is implemented by using a concept of a smart contract running on the ethereum blockchain as well as a react web application, which provides the user interface and interacts with the blockchain using the web3js api.
